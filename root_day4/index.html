      <h1>The Great Debate: Sesame or Poppy? </h1>
      <p>In the beginning of God's creation of the heavens and the earth.</p>
      <p>Now the earth was astonishingly empty, and darkness was on the face of the deep, and the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the water.</p>

      <p>And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.</p>
      <p>And God saw the light that it was good, and God separated between the light and between the darkness.</p>
      <p>And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night, and it was evening and it was morning, one day.</p>
