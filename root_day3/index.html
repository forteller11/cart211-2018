      <h3>Biography</h3>


      I was born in Montréal, but left for Edmonton when I was six years old, after four years (and a brief time in Lethbridge), I moved to Saskatchewan where I finished elementary and highschool.
      <br>
      I’ve always been interested in both developing technical skills (drawing, programming, special affects…) aswell as more academic and conceptual areas. because of this video games, but not too commercial, so Concordia.
      <br>
      Experience, I had a decent experience with a c-based language similar to javascript, but no experience with html or css whatsoever. I’ve always considered graphic design one of my weaknesses, and perhaps because of this, have not been particular interested in graphic/web design. However I am excited to learn anyways, and I’m loving the readings and history we’re getting so far on the theory side of things.
