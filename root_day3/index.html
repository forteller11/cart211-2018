    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>
      I was born in Montr√©al, but left when I was six for Edmonton, after four years (and a brief time in Lethbridge) I moved to Saskatchewan where I finished elementary and high school. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout high school I realized that I thoroughly enjoyed academic work (at least in the humanities), but that I simultaneously needed to be working on projects which were technically and creatively challenging to stay motivated. I
      identified video games (in large part due to my proximity to them throughout my childhood) as an avenue for me to channel both my academic, technical and creative interests. I subsequently chose to enter into the Computations Arts program
      at Concordia as I thought it would offer a nice balance between these three areas (academic, technical and creative); also the program offered the geographical perk of being located in one of the North American centers for both the AAA and
      independent games scene. <br><br></p>
    <p>
      I have no experience with web design, html, or CSS whatsoever, however, I do have some decent experience with a c-based language similar to JavaScript. I tend to think of graphic design (and by extension web design) as one of my weakest
      skills. So far, I am loving the histories and historiographical analyses pertaining to the internet!
