      <h3>Week One <br>
        <i>We May Think</i>
         <br> Vannevar Bush, 1945</h3>

<p>
      I find myself immediately agreeing with Bush’s basic premise that as the sciences (and to generalise, societies) become more specialized the difficulty of disseminating knowledge outside of the academic disciplines in which research was conducted naturally becomes greater. And, therefore, as this specialization occurs methods and technologies related to the efficient and effective storage, organization, and dissemination of this knowledge becomes increasingly vital to prevent wisdom from being lost forever within departments or with academic elites. <br></p><p>
  I am also in accord with Bush’s philosophy for effective organization which from my understanding discourages arrangements of knowledge by index (nested markers which organize texts mostly arbitrarily relative to their content and meaning), in favour of arrangements by association, which – according to Bush’s conception of the term – takes into account the content and context of texts and relates them accordingly when one selects. From my understanding this parallels the contemporary difference between the looking up of an individual website via an objectively unique (although conceptually not very useful) URL versus typing some keywords into a search engine and being presented with a countless number of content-related articles, videos, books etc. <br><br></p><p>
  I find his imagined technology, Memex, which in theory realizes his association-over-indexing philosophy, especially interesting. I find Memex intriguing not so much at its face value: as a conceptual blueprint for a contemporary realization of the technology; but rather as a primary historical account: for through Bush’s predictions of future technology and comments on the realism or absurdity of his prophecies we can make informed guesses about the technological paradigms that existed at the time of authoring. For instance, the idea of storing and accessing information purely digitally must have been unfathomable at the time based off the fact that Bush imagines ameliorated microfilm technology instead of floppy disks or hard drives as the solution to reducing the physical footprint of information storage. I know that this particular paradigm is more largely indicative of Bush’s general time and place as the same technologies were present in sci fi classics written at the same time. In Frank Herbert’s Dune published in 1965 thousand-page books are condensed to occupy no more than the space of a matchbook by using thin filament paper (26, Dune), this filament paper is then rendered legible to the naked eye using projections and/or magnifiers – an identical technology to Bush’s hypothesizes. <br> <br> </p><p>
  I also love the ingenuity of Bush’s Memex, for since he cannot fathom a world in which computers and algorithms can interpret and organize content meaningfully, Bush instead employs crowd sourcing to meaningfully associate related texts in what he terms trails. I feel the 1945 Memex was incredibly insightful: as it seems both private, collaborative; allowing for both precise index-based and more organic association-based searches just like the contemporary internet. <br><br></p><p>
  However, I would have to disagree with Bush’s basic assumption which necessitates that the grouping-by-association be crowdsourced in the first place: that is the assumption that computers can only be used for logically or repetitive tasks, are uncreative, and more fundamentally are in some way or another essentially different to biological, human minds. I believe that the recent rise in popularity of neural networks, machine learning and just artificial intelligence in general applied not only in fields of science and abstract logic but also in areas more traditionally associated with creativity and culture shows how technically deterministic entities can behave (by all practical definitions) in very creative ways. These developments blur hard lines which were understandably, yet mistakenly, drawn seventy years ago between (to use the gendered language present in the article) man and machine. <br><br></p><p>
  (In fact, even before the rise of neural networks and AI’s algorithms used in web browsers could already meaningfully associate texts by their contents without having to rely on crowd sourcing as a creative crutch.)

<h3>Week Two <br>
  <i>A Brief History of the Internet </i>
   <br> Roy Rosenzweig, 1998</h3>

   <p>
     I’m grateful to be introduced to the history of the internet and be confronted not with a single canonical History but instead with the beautiful complexity and plurality that is the many sometimes complimentary, sometimes contradictory histories of the internet. Being that this is a “brief” history I also appreciate that much of the historiographical analysis is done for me as Rosenzweig speaks explicitly to the academic backgrounds of, and the economic and institutional contexts in which the authors wrote their histories – helping to explain why varying emphasis is placed on different aspects of the internets’ past in the presented works. <br><br></p><p>
   I found particularly relevant the discussion surrounding the binary roots of the internet: for at the same the time the internet provided and still provides the potential for both awesome increases and decreases in the centralization of capital, information… and ultimately – power. Rosenzweig made sense of these contradictory potentials and forces by placing the internets’ histories within the similarly polar political context of 60’s America. The article painted the picture of the establishment on one side: a big post-war, bureaucratic, military focused government (thanks in large part to FDR’s recent consolidations in federal power) acting as the centralizing “closed world” force; while Rosenzweig places counter-culture movements of the 60’s on the other side: Hippies, politically minded computer hobbyists turned hackers, disenfranchised computer science students providing inclusive alternatives to exclusive military networks… all of these players are cited as forces of decentralization in the early days of internet. This history gives context to the differing contemporary philosophies surroundings the extent to which the internet should be free in a socialist decentralized (yet regulated) sense or should be free in the economic (tending towards centralization) capitalist sense.

 <h3>Week Three <br>
   <i>Web Work -- a history of internet art </i>
    <br> Rachel Greene, 2000</h3>
    <p>
       <i> Whatever images of net.art projects grace these pages, beware that, seen out of their native HTML, out of their networked, social habitats, they are net.art equivalents of animals in zoos. (Rachel Greene) </i><br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
       I have been conditioned when offered urls in art related articles to expect some sort of documentation, memorial or post mortem of a performance, installation, canvas… which hopelessly attempts to recreate the experience of a work ex situ.  For this reason, one can imagine how strange and exciting it was for me to read an introduction to an article explaining that the urls it offered and the sites they represented were the original medium and intended context of the art (medium/movement/discourse) which it would be chronicling. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
       Visiting the various websites linked to in Rachel Greene’s article was creatively inspiring and made me realize just how small and rigid my understanding of what a webpage can be and look like are. I found particularly inspiring JODI.org largely because of how overtly hostile many of the web pages were: flashing images, dense seas of alphanumeric characters, lists of ip addresses, pages which implored you enter a password and then reportedly XSSPOSED you or an endless amount of other ridiculously unintuitive or ineligible user interfaces. It reminded me of an idea which was introduced to me (I think) in The White Cube when Bryan O’Doherty explains how the modern gallery space (the white cube) has pretensions of elevating art contained within it to a godlike status as it tries to removes all historical, social and political context from the work — granting all objects within the space an ahistorical, universal condition. Simultaneously, the white cube encourages a disembodied experience where persons are transformed into spectators — objective observers of these elevated objects uninhibited by physicality. Works which involve the creation of hostile spaces, for instance: Duchamp’s First Papers of Surrealism subvert these modern pretensions of the white cube by forcedly reminding viewers of their presence within and in relation to the gallery space and art. Jodi.org’s work has a similar affect of making the typical web surfer (principally because of the sites’ hostility to the user) suddenly and uniquely aware of the underlining architectures, authors, and interfaces of the net – thus dragging the net back into the social, political and technical context of reality. <br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
       Lastly Carolina’s article focuses a lot on the commercial and economic struggles of net.artists trying to market themselves and make money as much of their work is by the very nature its medium available to all with network access. I wonder if that means that art scenes which do not rely on private buyers but instead government funding like here in Canada would tend to promote the production and proliferation of net.art and net.artists? <br><br>
