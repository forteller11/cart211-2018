      <h1>Transformations in section 2</h1>
      <p>Much of this work on transformations has, however, been restricted to the perceptual
        level, that is, pupils have been given opportunities to physically manipulate figures
        using cut-outs, paper folding, geoboards, tracings, etc. Learners are seldom
        challenged to transfer their perceptual understanding to a representational level, that
        is, to perform the operations mentally. It is this ability to perform transformations
        mentally that is valuable in mathematics.</p>
      <p>Similarity is studied informally in Grade 9 and more formally in Grade 12, but the
        transformation dimension (enlargement) is not explored.
      </p>
      <p>Transformations are not, however, restricted to isometric transformations and
        enlargements. Light (1993) uses the work of Klein to classify the different
        transformations as shown in the table that follows. Examples of the use of each
        transformation and the geometrical context in which each occurs are also given</p>
      <p>MALATI believes that the range of transformations studied at school can be widened
        â€“ the examples mentioned above can be used to study the different transformations
        on the Van Hiele visual and analysis levels in the intermediate and senior phases.
        The actual differences between the transformations need not be made explicit in
        these phases.
